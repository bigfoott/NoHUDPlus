Disable the in-song HUD in your headset or on the mirror.

## Setup
Drag all included folders into your game directory and launch the game. Default settings will be created in `UserData/modprefs.ini`.

## Usage
Enable/disable No HUD mode through the in-game player settings menu as you would normally. If at least one of the NoHUD+ options is set, the mod will override the standard No HUD mode. Otherwise, standard No HUD mode is used.

## Configuration
**NOTE:** These settings can be toggled in the in-game game settings menu "NoHUDPlus"

**OTHER NOTE:** The mirror option is only available if CameraPlus (or a related camera mod) is installed.
